# Ocr4pdf

System dependencies include:
* Tesseract
* poppler-utils â€” for its `pdfinfo`, `pdftocairo` and `pdfunite` commands

## Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

    $ bundle add ocr4pdf

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

## Usage

Currently, Ocr4pdf only supports input files in PDF format.
```ruby
require 'ocr4pdf'

new_pdf_blob = Ocr4pdf.new('path/to/file.pdf').create_ocr_pdf

# To save the new PDF to disk, use:
File.binwrite('path/to/new_file.pdf', new_pdf_blob)

```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
